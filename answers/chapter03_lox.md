1. // TODO

2. Things that i wonder,
- how does this language handle error?
- can this language chain operation?
- can this language inline return a value?
- can this language use increment?

3. i think this language would be great with these features,
- build-in map
- for-in or for-each loop and switch
- network library
- modulus operation
- ways to interact with our os
