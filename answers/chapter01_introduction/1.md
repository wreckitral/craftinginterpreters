1. There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the little system I cobbled together to write and publish this book. What are they?

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Markdown
- Makefile
- Mustache

so i checked the answers there was jinja2, but i cant seem to find it anywhere, turns out it was already migrated to Mustache template.
